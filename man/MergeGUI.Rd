\usage{MergeGUI(filenames)

}
\description{
This function will start with an starting interface, allowing 1)
selecting several data files; 2) doing the next command with more
than one files. There are two commands which could be selected:
match the variables, match the cases by the key variable. In the
matching-variable interface the user can 1) check the matching of
the variables among files and switch the variable names if they
are wrongly matched; 2) look at the numerical and graphical
summaries for the selected variables, or the dictionary for
selected factor varibles; 3) observe the misclassification rate,
KS-test p-values and Chi-square test p-values for each variable,
which helps to determine whether any transformation is needed for
the variable; (For each variable, the user may want to know
whether it could distinguish the sources correctly. So the
misclassification rate is calculated through the tree model.
KS-test is used to check whether any variable has different
distributions for different sources. And the Chi-square test is
useful when the user is interested in the pattern of missing
values among the sources.) 4) change the name or class for any
variable; 5) export the merged dataset and the summary for it. In
the matching-case interface the user can determine a primary key
for each data file and then merge the cases by the key.}
\details{The merging GUI consists of four tabs. In the preferences tab,
user can choose whether the numerical p-values or the flag symbols
are displayed in the summary tab; whether the y-scales are free
for different data files when drawing the plots faceted by the
sources. In the checking tab, each data file has a list of
variable names, and the GUI will automatically arrange the order
of variable names to align the same names in one row. The user can
switch the order of the variables in one file's list. It is
possible to undo, redo, or reset the matching. In the summary tab,
there is a list of variable names on the left which corresponds to
the checking tab. The misclassification rate, KS-test p-values and
Chi-square test p-values for each variable may also be presented
with the variable names. On the top right there are three buttons:
Numeric summary, Graphical summary, and Dictionary. And the
results could be shown below the buttons. For the graphical
summary, histogram or barchart will be shown if a single variable
is selected. A scatterplot will be drawn if two numeric or two
factor varaibles are chosen. Side-by-side boxplots will be
presented when one numeric and one factor varaibles are
selected. A parallel coordinate plot is shown when all the
variables selected are numeric and there are more than two
variables. If more than two variables are chosen but the classes
of the variables are mixed, i.e. some are numeric, some are factor
or character, then histograms and barcharts will be drawn
individually. All the plots are facetted by the source. In the
export tab the user could select all or none variables by click
the buttons or choose several varaibles by Ctrl+Click. Then the
export button will export the merged data and the numeric
summaries of the selected variables into two csv files.}
