\title{Obtain the intersection of a list of vectors}
\usage{intersect2(vname, simplifiedname = vname)

}
\description{
Function "intersect" in the base package can only intersect two
vectors. The function "intersect2" is designed to obtain the
intersection and the difference for more than two vectors. The
input should be a list whose elements are the vectors, and the
outputs include the intersection of all vectors and a list whose
elements are the input vectors substracting the intersection.
Besides, intersect2 allows the labels of the vectors. If a list of
labels is given in the input, then the outputs will also include a
matrix of labels which match the intersection for the vectors, and
a list of labels which match the left part of the vectors.}
\value{The outputs are 'public', 'individual', 'uniq', and
'simpleuniq'.  'public' is a vector of the intersection of
'simplifiedname'.  'individual' is a matrix with the original
colnames matched to 'public' in all files.  'simpleuniq' is a list
of the left part of 'simplifiedname' if we pick 'public' out.
'uniq' is a list of the left part of 'vname' if we pick
'individual' out.}

\arguments{\item{vname}{A list of labels.}
\item{simplifiedname}{A list of vectors to make the intersection.
Each element in the list has the same length as the corresponding
element in vname. Default to be vname. If simplifiedname is not
vname, then it works as the real vectors to match, and vname is
like the labels of simplifiedname. If simplifiedname is the same
as vname, then the returned value simpleuniq=uniq.}
