    name.class)

}
\description{
This function is used to detect whether the matched variables from
different files have different missing patterns. For each
variable, it will firstly count the missing and non-missing values
among the sources, and then form a contingency table. The p-value
of Chi-square test is computed from the contingency table and
finally reported for the variable.}
\value{A vector of p-values from the Chisquare-test for the
missings of each variable. The p-values are between 0 and 1.}

\arguments{\item{nametable.class}{A matrix of the matched variable names. The
number of columns is equal to the number of files. Each row
represents a variable that is going to be merged. Any elements
except NA in nametable.class must be the variable names in
dataset.class.}
\item{dataset.class}{The dataset list. The length of the
list is equal to the number of files, and the order of the
list is the same as the order of columns in nametable.class.}
\item{name.class}{A character vector of variable names. The length
of the vector must be equal to the number of rows in
nametable.class. Since the variable names in nametable.class may
not be consistent, name.class is needed to name the variables.}
