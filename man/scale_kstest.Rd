\description{Compute the p-values of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between
different sources for each variable.
This function is used to detect whether the matched variables from
different files have different distributions. For each variable,
it will compute the pairwise KS-test p-values among the sources,
then report the lowest p-value as the indice for this variable.}
\value{A vector of p-values from the KS-test for each
variable.The p-values are between 0 and 1, or equal to 9 if one of
more groups only have NA's.}

\arguments{\item{nametable.class}{A matrix of the matched variable names. The
number of columns is equal to the number of files. Each row
represents a variable that is going to be merged. Any elements
except NA in nametable.class must be the variable names in
dataset.class.}
\item{dataset.class}{The dataset list. The length of the
list is equal to the number of files, and the order of the
list is the same as the order of columns in nametable.class.}
\item{name.class}{A character vector of variable names. The length
of the vector must be equal to the number of rows in
nametable.class. Since the variable names in nametable.class may
not be consistent, name.class is needed to name the variables.}
\item{varclass}{A character vector of variable classes. The length
of the vector must be equal to the number of rows in
nametable.class. All the classes should be in "numeric",
"integer", "factor", and "character". Default to be null, then
it will be determined by \code{\link{var.class}}.}
