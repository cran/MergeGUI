\section{Introduction}

The MergeGUI package intends to visualize the process of merging multiple
datasets. The mergence can be directed vertically -- merging the variables,
or horizontally -- merging the cases, or say, merge the IDs. 


\section{Design of GUI}

Beginning with the command 
\begin{quotation}
\texttt{> library(MergeGUI)}

\texttt{> mergeGUI()}
\end{quotation}
the starting interface will show up. The following instruction will
give a tour in this package.


\subsection{Starting Interface}

The users can open files in the starting interface and select some
files to do the next command. They can match the variables or match
the observations by the key. At least two files need to be selected
to match. If no files are specifically chosen, then all the files
are used in the next step.

\subsection{The Matching-ID Interface}

In some situations, we have several files containing the same subjects
or experimental units, but different treatments or recording times.
Then one of the desirable tasks is to combine those files by the subject
ID's. In the `Combination' window, the last button is `Match by the
Key'. Clicking it we'll see the window `Matched Primary Key'. With
each file we select, one primary key is needed. A warning message
will pop up if the variable we selected is not a proper key, for example
if some of its records are replicated.

\begin{center}

\par\end{center}

Upon clicking the button `Match by the Key', we can save the merged
data into a new csv file.

\par\end{center}


\subsection{The Matching-Variable Interface}

This part allows the user to match the data from the different experimental
units that have the same variables. In the `Combination' window, the
second button is `Match the Variables'. Clicking it will open the
window `Matched Variables'. This window has four tabs. We can activate
one page by clicking the tab title.


\subsubsection{Perferences Tab}

In the preferences tab, the user can choose whether the y-scales are
free for different data files when drawing the plots facetted by the
files; whether the numerical p-values or the flag symbols are displayed
in the summary tab or not. All the changes will be presented in the
Summary tab.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\paperheight]{preferences-windows}
\par\end{center}


\subsubsection{Checking Tab}

The `Checking' page shows the automatic variable matching results
and allows the user to change the variable matches. The variables
present in each file are listed in separate panes. The order that
the variable names are listed shows the variable matching.

The functionality is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Variables are automatically matched by variable name in an initial
pass through the data. These matched variables from the different
files are aligned along a row.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\paperheight]{match_top-windows}
\par\end{center}

\item Switch which variables are matched by switching the order of the variables
in one file's list. The re-matching is achieved by clicking on two
variable names in the same file list. Here the variable Score in studentsB.csv
should be matched the variable Grade in the other two files.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\paperheight]{match_switch-windows}
\par\end{center}

\item Unmatched variables are listed at he bottom of the list. Here the
last two variables in studentsA.csv, studentsB.csv have no equivalent
in studentsC.csv.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\paperheight]{match_bottom-windows}
\par\end{center}

\item It is possible to undo, redo, or reset the matching. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Summary}

The `Summary' page, allows the user to check the values of the variables
numerically, or graphically and set up a data dictionary for the categorical
variables.

Select the variables that you want to summarize and then click `Numeric
summary' shows numerical information about these variables by file
in the right panel. Here the variables Grade and Score have been selected
for summary. Grade is categorical because it shows the student score/total
score. Factor summaries are used, number of observations, levels,
and the three most frequent levels. Score is a numeric variable so
the summary statistics are used, mean, standard deviation, minimum,
median and maximum, along with number of observations and number of
missing values.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\paperheight]{numeric_summary-windows}
\par\end{center}

Select a single variable and click `Graphical summary' to get plots
of the variable, facetted by file. For the graphical summary, 
histogram or barchart will be shown if a single variable
is selected. A scatterplot will be drawn if two numeric or two
factor varaibles are chosen. Side-by-side boxplots will be
presented when one numeric and one factor varaibles are
selected. A parallel coordinate plot is shown when all the
variables selected are numeric and there are more than two
variables. If more than two variables are chosen but the classes
of the variables are mixed, i.e. some are numeric, some are factor
or character, then histograms and barcharts will be drawn
individually.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\paperheight]{graphical_summary-windows}
\par\end{center}

Select several factor variables and click `Dictionary' to see all
levels of the factors. The same levels shown in all files will be
listed in front of other levels.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\paperheight]{dictionary-windows}
\par\end{center}

By double clicking one variable, the attributes window will pop up.
The user can edit the variable name or change the class of the variable.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\paperheight]{attributes-windows}
\par\end{center}

When the Preference tab sets `Show p-values' or `Show the flag symbols',
the variable list in the Summary tab looks as follows. All the flag
symbols correspond to the p-values which are less than 0.05. 
For each variable, the column `Unit' gives the misclassification 
rates for each variable if the user wants to know whether any 
variable could distinguish the sources correctly. The 
misclassification rate is calculated through the classification 
tree (the rpart package).
The column `Dist' compute the p-values of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
tests between different sources. It is used to check whether any 
variable has different distributions for different sources.
`Miss' gives the p-values of the Chi-square tests for the counts 
of missing and non-missing values between different files for each 
variable. So the user could know the pattern of missing values 
among the sources.

\subsubsection{Export}

This tab provide the interface for saving the matched data into csv
file. The user could select all or none variables by click the two
buttons or choose several varaibles by Ctrl+Click. The export button
will export the merged data and the numeric summaries of the selected
variables into two csv files.
